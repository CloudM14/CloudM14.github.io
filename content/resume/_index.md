Hey there! I'm a current student at Bunker Hill Community College, with a background in nursing. I've decided to chase my lifelong dream of working for NASA. It's been quite the journey from the healthcare field to the stars, but I'm excited to combine my skills and passions in new, stellar ways. Let's shoot for the moon!
