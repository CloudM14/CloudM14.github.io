**From Caregiver to Coder: Finding My Path at Bunker Hill**

Starting over is never easy—especially when you’re not sure where the path will lead.

When I first stepped onto the campus of Bunker Hill Community College, I was making a complete pivot. I had been in nursing school, driven by a deep-rooted desire to care for others. But after facing injury and reevaluating what I truly wanted, I took what felt like a shot in the dark: I switched to computer science. It wasn’t just a change of major—it was a leap of faith.

At first, I felt like an outsider. I went from being a caregiver—someone who provided immediate help and comfort—to sitting in front of a screen, debugging code and learning algorithms. But I held on to one hope: that this new path could empower me in ways that would one day allow me to give back even more—to my family, to my community, and to the world.

The turning point came when I joined Phi Theta Kappa and Student Government. For the first time in a long time, I felt grounded. Surrounded by peers who were also pushing through challenges and chasing purpose, I found clarity. I discovered not only who I wanted to become, but how I could actually get there. Leadership, service, and growth became the backbone of my college experience.

That spark ignited something powerful. I had the opportunity to lead our college’s NASA MINDS project, where my team *SolarFold* developed an origami-inspired solar panel array based on JWST technology—and we were ranked Top 10 nationally. Alongside that, I served as President of the Alpha Kappa Mu Chapter for PTK and Vice President of Technology in Student Government, learning every day how to use my voice and vision to make an impact.

And despite the long nights, the code errors, the presentations, and the pressure—I graduated with **Highest Honors** with my Associate of Science in Computer Science.

The journey has been anything but linear. But it’s proof that sometimes the biggest risks lead to the most meaningful rewards. I’m proud of how far I’ve come, and I’m even more excited for what’s next.

As I prepare to transfer and begin the next chapter of my academic journey, I carry with me not only knowledge and skills—but purpose, drive, and a commitment to lift others as I climb.

Here’s to the road ahead.
