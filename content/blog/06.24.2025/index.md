## From Setback to Stardust: My Journey to USC and Beyond

Graduating with highest honors from Bunker Hill Community College has been one of the most surreal and rewarding moments of my life. As I walked across that stage, I wasn't just accepting a diploma—I was carrying the weight of every late night, every challenge, and every moment of doubt I fought through to get here.

Now, I’m incredibly proud (and honestly still a little in disbelief) to share that I’ve been blessed with the opportunity to continue my bachelor’s degree at the University of Southern California. USC has always been a dream for me—not just for its reputation, but for the doors it opens, especially in fields like astrophysics.

It’s hard not to reflect on how far I’ve come. A few years ago, I was on a completely different path. After a football injury, I found myself in nursing school, unsure of where I was headed. I had lost my original passion and was simply trying to figure out my next step. But sometimes, detours are just disguised redirections. That difficult period of my life pushed me to rediscover my curiosity for the universe, for science, and eventually for astrophysics.

Today, I feel closer than ever to achieving my dream of contributing to space exploration and making a difference in the world through science. But I also know this is just the beginning. I have so much to be proud of, but even more to accomplish. The road ahead is long, and I welcome it with open arms and an open heart.

To anyone out there who feels like they’ve lost their way—trust the process. Keep moving, keep learning, and don’t be afraid to pivot. You might just find yourself closer to the stars than you ever imagined.

Thank you to everyone who’s supported me so far. Here’s to USC, to growth, and to the universe that awaits.
