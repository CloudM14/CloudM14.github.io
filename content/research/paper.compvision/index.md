This project explores the powerful intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision, highlighting how machines can be trained to interpret and understand visual information with human-like accuracy. From facial recognition and object detection to real-time video analysis, we investigate the core technologies that enable computers to "see" and make decisions based on visual data.
