Welcome to Bunker Hills 2025 NASA Minds project Led by me Noah A. Cox. The projects name is Deployable Oragami Solar Array (DOSA), and made by the team SolarFold this is a student-led NASA MINDS project focused on advancing deployable solar technology for space missions. Inspired by the folding mechanisms of the James Webb Space Telescopeâ€™s solar shade, our team engineered a compact, origami-based solar panel system designed to optimize energy efficiency and spatial economy for future spacecraft and lunar habitats.

Our solution prioritizes lightweight design, structural reliability, and maximum surface area deploymentâ€”key features for the next generation of space infrastructure. By merging engineering innovation with biomimicry and space-grade materials, SolarFold represents a creative leap in the design of compact power systems for the harsh conditions of space.

ðŸ“Œ Curious about our results?
Check out our visual poster and technical paper below to dive deeper into the design process, testing methodology, and final system performance.
